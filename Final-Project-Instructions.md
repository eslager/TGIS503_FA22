## Final Project: Storytelling through maps

### Introduction

In the final project, you will be combining all the skills you have learned so far through the quarter to create a compelling and persuasive story or narrative using web maps, along with additional content. The project is intended to draw upon your HTML and CSS skills to build a beautiful and readable site, as well as your JavaScript and web-mapping skills to display data in an understandable manner. 

The story you tell is up to you, but it must be complex enough to involve at least two maps (or one map with complex interactivity) with numerous data sets. Just like Lab 1, it can be as whimsical or as practical as you want it to be. 

The project may serve as a stepping stone for your capstone project. In the event that your capstone involves a web-portal, web-interface, or digital maps, this project can act as a sandbox to learn and apply the skills that you will be using in upcoming quarters. I encourage you to take this opportunity to consider what tools, plugins, interactions and requirements your capstone might have and to learn them as part of this project where I can guide and support you.

### Specifications

**Your final product must include either:** 

* A minimum of two maps, or 
* A minimum of one map with complex interactivity. Complex interactivity refers to event-driven repositioning of the map view (center and zoom) or addition/removal of map layers. Generally, this is what we talk about as a storymap. A good tool for this is the JavaScript library [StoryMap JS](https://storymap.knightlab.com/advanced/). 

**Additionally, your project should include:** 

* A minimum of three data sets. You may use data sets you used in previous labs, primary data sets you've created, and/or secondary data sets you've found elsewhere. All data should be credited in the final product. 
* Appropriate layer styling and symbology (i.e. custom icons for points, choropleth based on attribute data, etc.)
* Appropriate interactivity (i.e. pop-up windows, marker clustering, etc.)
* Explanatory text
* Additional media such as images and charts. If you wish to include charts, I recommend using the library [ChartJS](https://www.chartjs.org/), which I will introduce in class in Week 8, to make your charts dynamic and interactive.
* Professional and uniform styling of the page and map(s)

Choosing the appropriate format (multi-map, or functionality that develops complex interactivity with one map) and any appropriate plugins to display your data is important. 

You should make conscious decisions about the libraries, plugins, etc. that you use, as well as the styling and symbology choices you make. Be prepared to explain why you made the decisions you made about your page and your maps., as the project requires an accompanying write-up to explain and justify the data, design, and functionality choices you make. 

### Learning Outcomes

This project will teach students to:

- Plan the development of an independent, narrative digital map project
- Combine HTML, CSS, JS skills acquired over the quarter to create a cohesive web story
- Develop a narrative and use spatial data to augment that narrative
- Apply basic cartography rules (colors, styles) to web-maps to enhance the contained data

### Deliverables

#### For the project proposal (due week 8):

Submit a ~1 page proposal specifying: 

* The overarching goal of your project and a summary of the story/narrative you hope to tell
* Data sources (please include links if available)
* Your intended mapping framework & whether you plan to make multiple maps or one map with advanced interactivity
* A brief description of each map
* A list of plugins and/or functionality you plan to include in your maps

#### For the final project (due week 10):

Submit:

- A URL link to an HTML webpage that has data, maps and background information, meeting the specifications listed above
- An accompanying write-up (~ 1 page; a word document or PDF, not part of your public-facing webpage but submitted to me on Canvas) that answers the following questions:
  1. What is the story you are trying to tell?
  2. What spatial data best helps to strengthen that story?
  3. Where is the data from, and did you need to do any analysis or transformations of the data before displaying it?
  4. Is there any non-spatial data that strengthens the story?
  5. How can the user interact with the map(s) or data?
  6. What plugins or additional libraries do the map(s) use? Why did you choose to include these?

#### Grading Breakdown

- 10 points possible for the proposal
- 30 points possible for the web page and all it associated content
- 10 points possible for the accompanying write-up
