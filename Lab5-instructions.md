# Lab 5: Routing with Leaflet and plugins

## TGIS 503, Fall 2022, Dr. Emma Slager

### Introduction

In this lab, you'll hone your technical skills by building a routing application. You'll also practice the more qualitative skills of evaluation and critique by assessing different Leaflet plugin options and reading their documentation. This lab uses the Leaflet mapping platform and a routing plugin, with additional functionality that is built on the Mapbox Directions API and Mapbox Geocoding API. All the files you need for this lab you will either create or download from the Internet. A list of deliverables is included at the end of these instructions.

### Part 1: Working with and assessing plugins

As you know from previous coursework, the core set of Leaflet features is designed to be as lightweight as possible, and additional features are provided through plugins. The majority of these plugins are built not by Leaflet staff but by community members. This modularity and customizability is typical of open-source software and has many advantages, but it also means quality can vary from plugin to plugin, so being able to assess them is important.

Navigate to the Routing section of the Leaflet Plugins page: https://leafletjs.com/plugins.html#routing. Here you’ll see a list of 8 different routing plugins. Leaflet provides the name and a link to an external website or GitHub repository with more information about the plugin, a brief description, and the name of the maintainer of the plugin. Pick three of these, and answer the following questions about each in your write up:

1. Title and maintainer of plugin:
2. What are the main functionalities of the plugin?
3. When was the last commit pushed to the GitHub repo where the plugin can be downloaded?
4. Do the developers provide a working demo of the plugin?
5. Based on the above information, how would you rank this in relation to the other two plugins you chose in terms of overall quality and usability? Justify your ranking.

### Part 2: Integrate routing in a Leaflet map

Now that you’re a little more familiar with the routing plugins available for Leaflet, let’s integrate one into a Leaflet map.

#### Step 1: Choose a routing plugin and set up your workspace

For basic routing functionality, I like Leaflet Routing Machine. Its latest version was released in November 2018, and the latest commit was made to its GitHub repository in June 2021. The documentation is more developed than many plugins, and there are working demos and even tutorials available. Let’s go with this one. As with most Leaflet libraries and plugins, we can download the necessary files (a CSS file and a JS file) for using Leaflet Routing Machine and host them ourselves, or we can find them on unpkg.com. We'll use the CDN unpkg.com version instead of downloading.

#### Step 2: Set up a minimal Leaflet map and initialize the routing plugin

In a text editor like Atom, let's create our files: index.html, styles.css, and scripts.js. Save these in a new folder. As always, consider uploading your folder as a repository to GitHub now, or you can save this step until later when you're ready to put your work up on GitHub Pages.

Edit your index.html file to include basic header information, CDN links to the Leaflet CSS and JS files, and a div for holding your map:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <title>give your page a title</title>
        <!-- Leaflet links -->
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.2/dist/leaflet.css"
            integrity="sha256-sA+zWATbFveLLNqWO2gtiw3HL/lh1giY/Inf1BJ0z14="
            crossorigin=""/>
       <script src="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.2/dist/leaflet.js"
            integrity="sha256-o9N1jGDZrf5tS+Ft4gbIK7mYMipq9lqpVJ91xHSyKhg="
            crossorigin=""></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="map"></div>
    </body>
</html>
```

Edit your styles.css file to include the following styling:

```css
body {
   padding: 0;
   margin: 0;
}

#map {
   position: absolute;
   width: 100vw;
   height: 100vh;
}
```

In your index.html `<head>`, include a link to your styles.css file, and in the `<body>`, after you've created the map div, include a link to your scripts.js file.

Next, initialize the map. Add the following code to your scripts.js file:

```javascript
var map = L.map('map').setView([47.25, -122.44], 11);

L.tileLayer('https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/{id}/tiles/256/{z}/{x}/{y}?access_token={accessToken}', {
    attribution: 'Map data &copy; <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC-BY-SA</a>, Imagery © <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a>',
    maxZoom: 18,
    id: 'mapbox/streets-v11',
    accessToken: 'yourAccessTokenGoesHere',
}).addTo(map);
```

Replace the text `yourAccessTokenGoesHere` with your own Mapbox access token. If you have not yet set up a Mapbox account, you will have to do this now at [this link](https://account.mapbox.com/auth/signup/). Once you've signed up and logged in, you can find your access token from [your account](https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/). The default public token will suffice for now.

You should now have an HTML page that loads a Leaflet map centered on the South Sound. The code you copied above uses the Mapbox streets style for its basemap. If you want, you can change this to another basemap, easily choosing from the Mapbox owned [style list](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/maps/styles/#mapbox-styles). Since we're making a navigation app here, change this to one of the navigation styles (day is a light theme, night is a dark theme).

Next let's add links to the CSS and JS files we need in order to initialize the routing plugin. In the ['Getting Started' section](http://www.liedman.net/leaflet-routing-machine/#getting-started) of the Leaflet Routing Machine homepage, you can find links to where the necessary CSS and JS files are accessible via unpkg.com. Copy those links into the `<head>` of your index. (Note that you should only copy the Leaflet Routing Machine CSS and JS links, as you've already added your Leaflet libraries, and the versions of the Leaflet libraries in the code sample on the Leaflet Routing Machine page are outdated.)

Then, under the section of code that intiliazes your map in your scripts.js file, add the following code to initialize the routing plugin:

```javascript
      var control = L.Routing.control({
          waypoints: [
              L.latLng(47.246587, -122.438830),
              L.latLng(47.318017, -122.542970)
          ],
           routeWhileDragging: true
      }).addTo(map);
```

This code initializes the routing control and adds it to the map. The waypoints option defines the start and stop points, while the `routeWhileDragging: true` option allows you to change the markers at the start and stop points by dragging them. Save your work and preview in a browser. You should see a map with markers at either end of a route and directions from Pinkerton Hall to Point Defiance. Try adding a third point at latitude and longitude 47.258024, -122.444725. Aha, now you can get pastries at Corina Bakery on the way to the park.

#### Step 3: Modifying options for the routing control

If you aren’t testing in Google Chrome, switch browsers now and open up the console in Google Developer Tools. You should see the warning below:

[![console message](https://github.com/eslager/TGIS503_FA2021/raw/main/console-message.png)](https://github.com/eslager/TGIS503_FA2021/blob/main/console-message.png)

By default, Leaflet Routing Machine uses routing software from the Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM, website: http://project-osrm.org/). They provide a demo server for testing with their product, but it often gets overloaded by calls from everyone in the world running tests with it (you may have already run into an HTTP 429 error telling you the server had too much traffic while testing). If you want to use OSRM in production you need to build and host your own server. This is a more complicated process than we can cover in one lab, so instead, we’ll change our routing service from OSRM to the Mapbox Directions API. As an option when you initialize the routing control, add the following line of code:

```javascript
router: L.Routing.mapbox('your-access-token-here'),
```

Note: remember that the options are declared inside the parentheses after the control is initialized. Thus, add the above code after the line of code that reads `routeWhileDragging: true`. Don't forget to add the necessary comma!

Insert your access token where requested, save, and open in Chrome. View the console in Developer Tools and you should no longer see the OSRM warning. Mapbox Directions API limits your free usage to 50,000 geolocation requests per month. The limit is more than sufficient for our purposes, but if you were to use this in a commercial product, you might exceed this and need to either pay for more usage or use a different routing service.

There are various options built in to the Routing control that we can change to modify the application. Find a full list of these options in the plugin's documentation here: http://www.liedman.net/leaflet-routing-machine/api/ Let's use a couple of these options to customize the Routing control.

First, change the units from metric to imperial by adding the following key-value pair as an option when you initialize the control:

```javascript
units:'imperial',
```

Next, let's make the control collapsible, since this will allow the user to maximize screen real estate for the map itself. Add this option:

```javascript
collapsible: true,
```

Now, review the documentation to figure out how you can set the control to be collapsed (not showing) when the map first loads and edit your code to achieve this. Hint: this is a boolean option available under the L.Routing.itinerary section.

#### Step 4: Add a geocoder so you can add waypoints by searching for an address or location

Routing software is only able to look up routes between coordinate pairs. Thus, if users want to find routes between addresses or other locations described as a string of text, we need a geocoder that can turn that address string into a coordinate pair. For this, we add a geocoding service as a plugin to extend our Leaflet Routing Machine plugin. It’s plugins on plugins, y’all!

The person who developed Leaflet Routing Machine also developed a Leaflet geocoder plugin that can be easily combined with the routing machine. It is called Leaflet Control Geocoder, and it can be used with many different geocoding services, such as [Nominatim](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim), [Bing Locations API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bingmaps/rest-services/locations/), [Google Geolocating API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start), or [Mapbox Geocoding API](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/search/), among others. We'll use a geocoder called [Photon](https://github.com/komoot/photon), because it is free and open-source and doesn't require an access token or API key.

To include the geocoder plugin, we first need to add links to its CSS and JS files in our index.html page. We’ll use unpkg again, though we could also download and store these locally. Add the following links to your index.html. I recommend using comments to help you keep track of which source links belong to which libraries:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet-control-geocoder/dist/Control.Geocoder.css" />
<script src="https://unpkg.com/leaflet-control-geocoder/dist/Control.Geocoder.js"></script>
```

Next, we initialize the plugin by adding the control to a map instance. As an option when you initialize the routing control, add the following line of code:

```javascript
  geocoder: L.Control.Geocoder.photon(),
```

Test this out. Your routing control should now include text boxes where you can search for locations that are geocoded and available for routing. Note that there are again options that you can change to modify the geocoder's behavior. Find the list of these options in the documentation here: https://github.com/perliedman/leaflet-control-geocoder#api.

#### Step 5: Add waypoints by clicking on the map

By default, the Leaflet Routing Machine does not allow a user to add waypoints by clicking on the map. However, this could be a useful functionality. Let’s add it. We’ll do this by creating a popup when the map is clicked that gives buttons for ‘start from this location’ or ‘go to this location’, then add some functions for when those buttons are clicked to get the route. In your scripts.js file, add the following:

```javascript
function createButton(label, container) {
    var btn = L.DomUtil.create('button', '', container);
    btn.setAttribute('type', 'button');
    btn.innerHTML = label;
    return btn;
}

map.on('click', function(e) {
    var container = L.DomUtil.create('div'),
        startBtn = createButton('Start from this location', container),
        destBtn = createButton('Go to this location', container);

    L.popup()
        .setContent(container)
        .setLatLng(e.latlng)
        .openOn(map);  
 });
```

This code uses functionality built into JavaScript itself and into Leaflet itself to build a little user interface. When the map is clicked, the code creates a popup that contains two buttons, one called `startBtn` and one called `destBtn`. Save your work and test this out. Clicking the map produces the popup with buttons, but if you click the buttons, nothing happens. Let’s change that.

When the “Start from this location” button is clicked, the first waypoint of the route should be replaced with the location that the user clicked on. Modifying the waypoints can be done with the method spliceWaypoints, which mimics the behavior of [JavaScript’s Array.splice](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_splice.asp). To replace the first waypoint, you tell Leaflet Routing Machine to remove one waypoint at index 0 (the first waypoint), and then add a new waypoint at the clicked location. Add this code inside the map’s click event handler (that is, after the `L.popup()` section of code and before the final `});`. e will refer to the click event, and e.latlng is the location clicked:

```javascript
    L.DomEvent.on(startBtn, 'click', function() {
        control.spliceWaypoints(0, 1, e.latlng);
        map.closePopup();
    });
```

Save and test. Your startBtn should now do something, but your destBtn won’t yet. Add another section of code inside the map's click event handler to add functionality to that button:

```
    L.DomEvent.on(destBtn, 'click', function() {
        control.spliceWaypoints(control.getWaypoints().length - 1, 1, e.latlng);
        control.show();
        map.closePopup();
    });
```

Observe that after this section of code modifies the array of `waypoints` in the `control` variable, it also uses a method called `control.show()` to expand the control from its initial collapsed position. After each button is clicked, the function also closes the popup.

Now that you’ve added the ability to get waypoints by clicking on the map, let’s get rid of the initial waypoints. In the part of your code where you initialize your routing control, comment out the starting waypoints and add the value null instead. Your code should look like this:

```javascript
waypoints: [
            null
              //L.latLng(47.246587, -122.438830),
              //L.latLng(47.318017, -122.542970)
          ],
```

Save and test. Is the ability to click on the map to create waypoints obvious to someone using this tool for the first time? I don’t think it is. Make some changes to your map to make it more so. There are many ways to do this—you could [create a textbox overlay](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33767463/overlaying-a-text-box-on-a-leaflet-js-map) on your Leaflet map with instructions, set an initial starting waypoint (instead of setting initial waypoints to `null`) with a popup that tells the user to click the map to change its location, include explanatory text above or below the map, etc. Come up with some way of making it obvious to your map user that they can click on the map to get directions to or from the location they clicked and implement it in your code.

#### Step 6: host your map online

Your final output for this part of the lab should be a Leaflet map with the following features/functionalities:

- Draggable markers
- Units in miles
- collapsible control that is hidden on initial map load
- Geocoder to enable searching for locations
- Clickable buttons to create waypoints
- Some modification that makes clickable functionality more obvious to users

Please host your map on GitHub Pages and include a link to its location in your lab write-up, which should also include your assessment of the Leaflet routing plugins from Part 1 of the lab instructions above.
